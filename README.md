- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Jaime Sanchez! I'm currently attending college with the intention of graduating with a degree in Software Engineering. Although I am new to programming I have developed a quick love towards the process of creation. Every day I try to learn a new topic or method that will not only benefit myself but others around me. I live by the S.A.S. motto "Who Dares Wins!".ðŸ¦¾
- ðŸ‘€ I am currently interested in game development and applications.
- ðŸŒ± I working towards becoming a full-stack developer
- ðŸ‘¥ I always love helping people, so if you want to collab or need any help I will do my best to assist. Feel free to reach out to me through the two various options.
