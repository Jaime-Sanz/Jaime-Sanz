- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Jaime Sanchez! I'm currently attending college with intention of graduating with a degree in Software Engineering. Although I am new to programming I have developed a quick love towards the process of creation. Everyday I try to learn a new topic or method that will not only benefit myself but others around. I live by the S.A.S. motto "Who Dares Wins!".ðŸ¦¾
- ðŸ‘€ I am currently interested in game development and applications.
- ðŸŒ± I am learning C++ with an emphasis on game development
- ðŸ‘¥ I always love helping people, so if you want to collab or need any help I will do my best to assist. Feel free to reach out to through the two various options.
